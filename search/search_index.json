Installing Prerequisites\" is important Ignore the instructions to setup an OpenShift cluster The option to use Cloud Shell mentioned above is not documented but you can use the \"Tools - Option 3: Install Tools on you Notebook\". All the required command line tools are already installed in the Cloud Shell, just start with \"Step 2: Get the code\" Skip sections \"2. Running the Java microservice locally\" and \"3.
